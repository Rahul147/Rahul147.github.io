      <description>Why do I need a blog? Let’s look at the fundamentals - penning down your thoughts isn’t easy, it forces you to think, which brings clarity and perspective. For example - at Amazon, meetings to present ideas do not start with PowerPoint slides but with dense and structured memo(s).
It’s easy to write bullet points on a slide and speak for hours on that topic but to structure it and pen it down is whole new ball game, you can’t just wing it.</description>

      <description>Let’s begin by describing Josephus problem:
 People are standing in a circle waiting to be executed. Counting begins at a specified point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a specified direction. After a specified number of people are skipped, the next person is executed. The procedure is repeated with the remaining people, starting with the next person, going in the same direction and skipping the same number of people, until only one person remains, and is freed.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I do not advice anyone to use this to watch content on Hotstar for free, this is purely for educational purposes.
 India Premier League can be streamed live on Hotstar, note that it’s a paid service. Here’s where Hotstar messed up, since Hotstar is so nice they allow you to watch a 10 minute preview without logging into the platform.
As soon as I noticed this, my spidey senses started to tingle.</description>
